# Pytorch for Semantic Segmentation


**This repo has been deprecated currently and I will not maintain it. Meanwhile, I strongly recommend you can refer to my new repo: [TorchSeg](https://github.com/ycszen/TorchSeg), which offers fast, modular reference implementation and easy training of semantic segmentation algorithms in PyTorch.**
